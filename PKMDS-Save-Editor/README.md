Thanks to Alex "eevee" Munroe (@eevee) at http://veekun.com/ for his SQLite Pokedex database, which powers this software. "veekun-pokedex.sqlite" was built from his database.

Thanks to the fine folks at SQLite.org for making it possible to use the Pokedex database... the source files "sqlite3.c" and "sqlite3.h" came from these people.

Thanks to those of Project Pokemon (http://projectpokemon.org/) who have helped research and document the underlying structure of Pokemon game save files.

Thanks to Nicholas Corgan (@ncorgan) for contributing directly to this project's code, making it more portable.
